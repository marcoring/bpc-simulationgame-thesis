The game consists of six rounds, during which the players make various decisions in up to ten process steps: Purchasing, Logistics, Frame Preparation, Sensor Preparation, Battery Preparation, Engine Preparation, Bike Construction, Application Development, Quality Assurance, and Sales. The decisions are different in every round. More details on each round can be read in the corresponding section. If you have any questions regarding the particular input field, just hover the mouse over the questionmark next to it. This will give you an explanation of the field's purpose. The goal of the game is to design the production and sales of the IoT bikes in a way that it is possible to earn more than the other teams. After each round, the profit for each team will be calculated. The team with the highest profit at the end of the sixth round is the winner.\" +\n          \"In order to save the data for each process step, the player has to click the 'Confirm' button at the bottom of the screen.
